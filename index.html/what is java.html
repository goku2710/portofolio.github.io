    <h1>What is Java?</h1>
    <h2>Why and How to learn Java Programming Language?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beginner Friendly and Competitive Edge</li>
        <p>The best part while you learn Java is its beginner-friendly nature. The syntax of Java matches a lot with its predecessors, C, C++, etc. Of course, Java has inherited its predecessors, 
            but also, Java comes with some advanced features to help programmers in real-time.</p>

        <p>Unlike its predecessors, Java comes with advanced memory management tools. Runtime Environment 
            takes care of memory allocation, reallocation, and deallocation automatically via an in-built software tool 
            called the Garbage collector.</p>    

        <p>The object-oriented programming nature of the language makes it more precise, readable, and the 
           best in class when it comes to getting started with real-time projects, even at the beginner's stage.</p>   
    

    
        <li>Code Portability and Versatility</li>
        <p>Java follows a fundamental principle that worked well for Java to date. The "Write Once, and Run Anywhere" principle.
            Now, Java uses a software tool that comes along with the Java download file. It is called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). <br><br>

            The primary objective of JVM is to convert the code written in the user's language into machine level 
            language (ByteCode), and then the interpreter will compile and execute the code. The same protocol is followed 
            regardless of the type of the host operating system.</p>

         <p>Java is also capable of working with various resources and working over the network.
            Data binding and security features make Java a most versatile programming language.</p>   
    

        <li>Open-source Library Support</li>
        <p>Java is commercialized. But most of the java features are still open-source and can also be used for building beginner 
            level and small-scale projects. Also, Java has a huge and never-ending ocean of libraries and support files. <br><br>

            Java has the support of libraries such as Apache Commons, Google Guava, Maven, and so on</p>
    

    
        <li>Wide Range of Development Tools</li>
        <p>So far, Java is the current IT industry leader, and the most sought programming language for 
            developing a wide range of software and applications.</p>
            <p>The reason for this is that they also develop a variety of software development tools for 
                assistance. To name a few, we have</p>
    

    <ul>
        <li>IntelliJ</li>
        <li>Eclipse</li>
        <li>Android Studio</li>
        <li>Netbeans</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
        <li>High Demand</li>
    <p>Java Developers are one of the high paid developers out here in the IT industry, and this 
        is because of the widespread dependency on the Java Programming language. <br><br>

        Salaries of Java developers are mentioned below.</p>
     </ol>   

     <h3>Applications of Java Language</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Web applications.</li>
        <li>Mobile Applications.</li>
        <li>Gaming applications.</li>
        <li>Desktop GUI Applications.</li>
        <li>Big Data technology.</li>
        <li>Embedded systems.</li>
     </ul>
