    <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
  
    <p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have 
        experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and 
        frameworks, among others.</p>
    <p>Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the application would be
        built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.</p>
    <p>In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like 
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development
        process.
        <br><br>
        In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like Node.js and PHP. 
        To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.
        <br><br>
        The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also 
        fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.
        <br><br>

        The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working 
        on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and
